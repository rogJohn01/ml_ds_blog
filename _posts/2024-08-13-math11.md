$$
\text{Let } f(x, y) \text{ be a function of two variables. The partial derivative of } f \text{ with respect to } x \text{ is given by:}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{\substack{\Delta x \to 0}} \frac{f(x + \Delta x, y) - f(x, y)}{\Delta x}
$$

<br>

$$
\text{Similarly, the partial derivative of } f \text{ with respect to } y \text{ is given by:}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \lim_{\substack{\Delta y \to 0}} \frac{f(x, y + \Delta y) - f(x, y)}{\Delta y}
$$

<br>

$$
\text{Proof: Partial Derivative with Respect to } x
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{\substack{\Delta x \to 0}} \frac{f(x + \Delta x, y) - f(x, y)}{\Delta x}
$$

$$
\text{In this proof, we treat } y \text{ as a constant while } x \text{ is changing.}
$$

$$
\text{This gives us the partial derivative of } f \text{ with respect to } x, \text{ while treating } y \text{ as constant.}
$$

$$
\text{Proof: Partial Derivative with Respect to } y
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \lim_{\substack{\Delta y \to 0}} \frac{f(x, y + \Delta y) - f(x, y)}{\Delta y}
$$

$$
\text{In this proof, we treat } x \text{ as a constant while } y \text{ is changing.}
$$

$$
\text{This gives us the partial derivative of } f \text{ with respect to } y, \text{ while treating } x \text{ as constant.}
$$

$$
\text{Therefore, partial differentiation allows us to understand how a multivariable function changes with respect to one of its variables while keeping the other variables constant.}
